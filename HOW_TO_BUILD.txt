How to build this branch:

1) Install RADOS

Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install librados-dev

RHEL/CentOS
sudo yum install librados2-devel


2) Configure (autotools only)

You will need to use --with-rados and set the include and library paths. You'll also need to build the parallel library.

Using the default locations on Ubuntu:

../develop/configure --enable-parallel --with-rados=/usr/include/rados,/usr/lib 2>&1 | tee configure.out


3) Build and run tests

The 'tests' are the RADOS examples which are run via 'make check-install'
