 *
 * \details H5Lmove() moves a link within an HDF5 file. The original link,
 *          \p src_name, is removed from \p src_loc and the new link,
 *          \p dst_name, is inserted at dst_loc. This change is
 *          accomplished as an atomic operation.
 *
 *          \p src_loc and \p src_name identify the original link.
 *          \p src_loc is the original location identifier; \p src_name is
 *          the path to the link and is interpreted relative to \p src_loc.
 *
 *          \p dst_loc and \p dst_name identify the new link. \p dst_loc is
 *          either a file or group identifier; \p dst_name is the path to
 *          the link and is interpreted relative to \p dst_loc.
 *
 *          \p lcpl_id and \p lapl_id are the link creation and link access
 *          property lists, respectively, associated with the new link,
 *          \p dst_name.
 *
 *          Through these property lists, several properties are available to
 *          govern the behavior of H5Lmove(). The property controlling creation
 *          of missing intermediate groups is set in the link creation property
 *          list with H5Pset_create_intermediate_group(); H5Lmove() ignores any
 *          other properties in the link creation property list. Properties
 *          controlling character encoding, link traversals, and external link
 *          prefixes are set in the link access property list with
 *          H5Pset_char_encoding(), H5Pset_nlinks(), and H5Pset_elink_prefix(),
 *          respectively.
 *
 * \note Note that H5Lmove() does not modify the value of the link; the new
 *       link points to the same object as the original link pointed to.
 *       Furthermore, if the object pointed to by the original link was already
 *       open with a valid object identifier, that identifier will remain valid
 *       after the call to H5Lmove().
 *
 * \attention Exercise care in moving links as it is possible to render data in
 *            a file inaccessible with H5L_MOVE. If the link being moved is on

 *
 *          If \p link_loc_id is a group identifier, the object pointed to by

 *          \p op. H5Literate2() does not recursively follow links into
 *          subgroups of the specified group.
 *
 *          Three parameters are used to manage progress of the iteration:
 *          \p idx_type, \p order, and \p idx_p.
 *
 *          \p idx_type specifies the index to be used. If the links have
 *          not been indexed by the index type, they will first be sorted by
 *          that index then the iteration will begin; if the links have been
 *          so indexed, the sorting step will be unnecessary, so the iteration
 *          may begin more quickly.
 *
 *          \p order specifies the order in which objects are to be inspected
 *          along the index \p idx_type.
 *
 *          \p idx_p tracks the iteration and allows an iteration to be
 *          resumed if it was stopped before all members were processed. It is
 *          passed in by the application with a starting point and returned by
 *          the library with the point at which the iteration stopped.
 *
 *          \p op_data is a user-defined pointer to the data required to
 *          process links in the course of the iteration. This pointer is
 *          passed back to each step of the iteration in the \p op callback
 *          function's \p op_data parameter. \p op is invoked for each link
 *          encounter.
 *
 *          \p op_data is passed to and from each iteration and can be used to
 *          supply or aggregate information across iterations.
 *
 * \remark Same pattern of behavior as H5Giterate().
 *
 * \note This function is also available through the H5Literate() macro.

 *
 * \details H5Lcreate_external() creates a new external link. An external link
 *          is a soft link to an object in a different HDF5 file from the
 *          location of the link, i.e., to an external object.
 *
 *          \p file_name identifies the target file containing the target
 *          object; \p obj_name specifies the path of the target object within
 *          that file. \p obj_name must be an absolute pathname in
 *          \p file_name, i.e., it must start at the target fileâ€™s root group,
 *          but it is not interpreted until an application attempts to traverse
 *          it.
 *
 *          \p link_loc_id and \p link_name specify the location and name,
 *          respectively, of the new link. \p link_name is interpreted relative
 *          to \p link_loc_id.
 *
 *          \p lcpl_id is the link creation property list used in creating the
 *          new link.
 *
 *          \p lapl_id is the link access property list used in traversing the
 *          new link. Note that an external file opened by the traversal of an
 *          external link is always opened with the weak file close degree
 *          property setting, #H5F_CLOSE_WEAK (see H5Pset_fclose_degree());
 *          any file close degree property setting in \p lapl_id is ignored.
 *
 *          An external link behaves similarly to a soft link, and like a soft
 *          link in an HDF5 file, it may dangle: the target file and object
 *          need not exist at the time that the external link is created.
 *
 *          When the external link \p link_name is accessed, the library will
 *          search for the target file \p file_name as described below:
 *
 *          - If \p file_name is a relative pathname, the following steps are
 *            performed:
 *            - The library will get the prefix(es) set in the environment
 *              variable \c HDF5_EXT_PREFIX and will try to prepend each prefix
 *              to \p file_name to form a new \p file_name.
 *            - If the new \p file_name does not exist or if \c HDF5_EXT_PREFIX
 *              is not set, the library will get the prefix set via
 *              H5Pset_elink_prefix() and prepend it to \p file_name to form a
 *              new \p file_name.
 *            - If the new \p file_name does not exist or no prefix is being
 *              set by H5Pset_elink_prefix(), then the path of the file
 *              associated with \p link_loc_id is obtained. This path can be
 *              the absolute path or the current working directory plus the
 *              relative path of that file when it is created/opened. The
 *              library will prepend this path to \p file_name to form a new
 *              \p file_name.
 *            - If the new \p file_name does not exist, then the library will
 *              look for \p file_name and will return failure/success
 *              accordingly.
 *          - If \p file_name is an absolute pathname, the library will first
 *            try to find \p file_name. If \p file_name does not exist,
 *            \p file_name is stripped of directory paths to form a new
 *            \p file_name. The search for the new \p file_name then follows
 *            the same steps as described above for a relative pathname. See
 *            examples below illustrating how target_file_name is stripped to
 *            form a new \p file_name.
 *
 *          Note that \p file_name is considered to be an absolute pathname
 *          when the following condition is true:
 *
 *          - For Unix, the first character of \p file_name is a slash (\c /).
 *            For example, consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5.
 *            If that target file does not exist, the new \p file_name after
 *            stripping will be \c A.h5.
 *          - For Windows, there are 6 cases:
 *            -# \p file_name is an absolute drive with absolute pathname.
 *               For example, consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5. If that
 *               target file does not exist, the new \p file_name after
 *               stripping will be \c A.h5.
 *            -# \p file_name is an absolute pathname without specifying drive
 *               name. For example, consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5.
 *               If that target file does not exist, the new \p file_name after
 *               stripping will be \c A.h5.
 *            -# \p file_name is an absolute drive with relative pathname.
 *               For example, consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5. If that
 *               target file does not exist, the new \p file_name after
 *               stripping will be \c tmp\A.h5.
 *            -# \p file_name is in UNC (Uniform Naming Convention) format with
 *               server name, share name, and pathname. For example, consider
 *               a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5. If that target file does not
 *               exist, the new \p file_name after stripping will be \c A.h5.
 *            -# \p file_name is in Long UNC (Uniform Naming Convention) format
 *               with server name, share name, and pathname. For example,
 *               consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5. If that target file
 *               does not exist, the new \p file_name after stripping will be
 *               \c A.h5.
 *            -# \p file_name is in Long UNC (Uniform Naming Convention) format
 *               with an absolute drive and an absolute pathname. For example,
 *               consider a \p file_name of \c /tmp/A.h5. If that target file
 *               does not exist, the new \p file_name after stripping will be
 *               \c A.h5.
 *
 *          The library opens target file \p file_name with the file access
 *          property list that is set via H5Pset_elink_fapl() when the external
 *          link link_name is accessed. If no such property list is set, the
 *          library uses the file access property list associated with the file
 *          of \p link_loc_id to open the target file.
 *
 *          If an application requires additional control over file access
 *          flags or the file access property list, see H5Pset_elink_cb(); this
 *          function enables the use of an external link callback function as
 *          described in H5L_elink_traverse_t().
 *
 * \attention A file close degree property setting (H5Pset_fclose_degree()) in
 *            the external link file access property list or in the external
 *            link callback function will be ignored. A file opened by means of
 *            traversing an external link is always opened with the weak file
 *            close degree property setting, #H5F_CLOSE_WEAK .

 *          index, \p idx_type, using a user-defined callback routine
 *          \p op. H5Literate1() does not recursively follow links into

 *
 *          Three parameters are used to manage progress of the iteration:
 *          \p idx_type, \p order, and \p idx_p.
 *
 *          \p idx_type specifies the index to be used. If the links have
 *          not been indexed by the index type, they will first be sorted by
 *          that index then the iteration will begin; if the links have been
 *          so indexed, the sorting step will be unnecessary, so the iteration
 *          may begin more quickly.
 *
 *          \p order specifies the order in which objects are to be inspected
 *          along the index \p idx_type.
 *
 *          \p idx_p tracks the iteration and allows an iteration to be
 *          resumed if it was stopped before all members were processed. It is
 *          passed in by the application with a starting point and returned by
 *          the library with the point at which the iteration stopped.
 *
 *          \p op_data is a user-defined pointer to the data required to
 *          process links in the course of the iteration. This pointer is
 *          passed back to each step of the iteration in the \p op callback
 *          function's \p op_data parameter. \p op is invoked for each link
 *          encounter.
 *
 *          \p op_data is passed to and from each iteration and can be used to
