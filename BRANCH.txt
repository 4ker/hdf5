This branch is a merge of Neil's original RADOS VOL connector
branch and develop and is kept in sync with the changes
in develop.

************
* BUILDING *
************

The code for the RADOS VOL connector lies entirely in
the H5VLrados* files in the src directory. The connector
is built as a static part of the library.

YOU MUST BUILD THE PARALLEL LIBRARY (--enable-parallel
in the autotools).

The autotools configuration files have been updated with
a --with-rados= option. CMake has not yet been updated
so you'll have to add the -I, -l, and -L flags yourself,
if necessary.

I build this branch on Ubuntu, with the system default
librados-dev package and its dependencies installed. On
Ubuntu, the librados libraries are installed in an odd
location, so I simplify the configure line by creating
an opt/librados directory in my home directory and
creating symlinks to the include and lib directories in
that.


***********
* TESTING *
***********

There are no tests for the RADOS VOL connector in the main
library, so running 'make check' won't provide much
information.

Once the library has been built, you can run some smoke
checks by running 'make install' and going to the
share/hdf5_examples/c/ directory and running the
run_rados_examples.sh script found there. That will
create a small pool (or clear it out if it exists)
and run all the example scripts in a sane order.

*** YOU WILL NEED TO COPY YOUR ceph.conf FILE
*** INTO THIS DIRECTORY FIRST!!!

This script is not as sophisticated as our usual test
scripts, so don't be surprised if it fails and you have
to run the tests manually.

Also note that CMake installs HDF5 to the system by
default, even in development branches. The autotools
will install HDF5 to an hdf5 subdirectory of the
build directory by default in development branches.
