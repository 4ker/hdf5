This branch is a copy of Neil's RADOS VOL connector branch.
Very few changes have been made to the branch so it stays
as a 'known good' version of the connector.

This is based off the ancient 'vol' branch and is wildy
out of sync with develop. You will not be able to move
the RADOS VOL connector built here to HDF5 1.12.0 without
a lot of surgery. The rados_vol branch in this repository
is kept in sync with develop and is probably the one
you want for that.

Note that this is a dead branch, so no effort has been
made to keep the MANIFEST sane, etc.

************
* BUILDING *
************

The code for the RADOS VOL connector lies entirely in
the H5VLrados* files in the src directory. The connector
is built as a static part of the library.

I build this branch on Ubuntu, with the system default
librados-dev package and its dependencies installed. I use
the autotools and the only thing I have to specify is the
linker flags:

LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/librados -lrados"

YMMV, but the autotools do no librados hunting so you may
need to specify things it can't figure out on its own.


***********
* TESTING *
***********

There are no tests for the RADOS VOL connector in the main
library, so running 'make check' won't provide much
information.

Once the library has been built, you can run some smoke
checks by running 'make install' and going to the
share/hdf5_examples/c/ directory and running the
run_rados_examples.sh script found there. That will
create a small pool (or clear it out if it exists)
and run all the example scripts in a sane order.

*** INTO THIS DIRECTORY FIRST!!!
